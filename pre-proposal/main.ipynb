    "# Purpose of the Dissertation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI issues abound.\n",
    "2. We ought to address these issues on a number of fronts.\n",
    "3. Ethics Education is one such front.\n",
    "4. I want to create a map\n",
    "    - of the moral theoretical commitments in AI Ethics Education\n",
    "    - organized around under what conditions (empirical and theoretical) each is appropriate\n",
    "    - in a way that is context sensitive to real teachers doing this kind of teaching today\n",
    "    - and illucidated by rich accounts of the experiences of real teachers doing this kind of teaching today\n",
    "5. (4) addresses a number of needs in (3).\n",
    "6. Teachers entering this space are often non-experts and resource constrained.\n",
    "    - A map provides them a way to organize their thinking.\n",
    "    - Rich descriptions show them the experiences of those who have already gone through these sort of things.\n",
    "7. Teachers in this space often teach how they were taught. Computing, compared to other fields, is a field without a rich history of ethics embedded into it. So it is thin guidance to stand on only how one was previously taught in this space.\n",
    "    - A map shows them other perspectives that they might be missing.\n",
    "    - Rich descriptions show them how others have mapped their teaching to their goals.\n",
    "8. Teachers in this space genuinely are trying to get it right! They have lots of thoughts! There's new conferences etc. around AI Ethics every day!\n",
    "    - A map helps prevent us from talking past one another.\n",
    "    - Rich descriptions show us the thickness of different ways of conceptualizing the same things.\n",
    "9. Teachers are doing this kind of teaching in a *wide* range of disciplines, because many are swept up in the race to shape the normative requirements and practical advice for how we create, train, deploy, use, consume, regulate, interpret, mitigate the harms of, and be subjects of AI.\n",
    "    - A map helps show opportunities for these disciplines to learn from one another.\n",
    "    - Rich descriptions give examples of how these interdisciplinary endeavors have been attempted in the past."
